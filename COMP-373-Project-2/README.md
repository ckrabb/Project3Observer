Project 3: Implementing Patterns
Project Description:
In this project, I implemented an observer pattern to update facilities about new or updated annual inspections. The subject, FacilityAnnualInspection, updates Facilitys that are registered as observers. FacilityInformation was updated to read in the updated information from FacilityAnnualInspection. Any updates in the date or inspectionID will update all registered facilities. In the FacilityMain.java file, tests for updating the annual inspection were included. Run FacilityMain.java to see results. 

Open: src/com/online/bookstore/model/view and run FacilityMain.java
